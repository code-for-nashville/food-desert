Project Definition and Scope
Provide a visual representation of the number of groceries in various areas of Davidson County, TN, along with an overlaid visual representation of income levels in various areas of Davidson County, TN.
Goals, In Other Words, So What?
* Empower policy makers to allocate resources
* Empower non-profits to apply for grants
* Empower citizens to ameliorate food insecurity.
* Empower business to offer food
* Empower further research and development
* Empower citizens to request assistance[a][b]
General Requirements
* Data
   * Food Desert classification
      * See CPS Food Security variable definitions https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HIipblb2gqdqAL_HY3J_bJijA2CpBzOYoT0Ct9xxpk8/edit?usp=sharing
   * Food Source Information
      * Food Source parent class  will include the following information:
         * Name of establishment
         * Address
         * Year established (or, if established pre-2010, that fact as well)
         * Gross sales per year
         * Food sales as a percentage of gross sales
         * Local vs chain
      * Grocery Stores
         * The grocery data type will be a single instance type inheriting from the “All Food Sources” parent class.. For example, each Kroger store location will be a separate data object. Grocery Store instances will include additional attributes:
            * Type of store, e.g. big-box, specialty, convenience store, general store
            * Accept WIC/food stamps
      * Restaurants
         * The restaurant data type is also a single instance type inheriting from the “All Food Sources” parent class. Restaurant instances will include additional attributes:
            *  type of food service, e.g. fast food, dine-in, take-out, cafeteria, salad bar, all-you-can-eat, …
            * Menu, e.g. sandwiches, mexican, meat-and-three, ...
   * Income Level Information
      * The income level data type will be based on census tract, as available at https://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/dc10map/tract/st47_tn/c47037_davidson/DC10CT_C47037_CT2MS.txt
      * The income level data type will include the following information:
         * Year of information
         * Percentage population with low vs no vs affluent (i.e., not low or no classification) income 
         * Percentage of population with fixed vs variable income
   * Population Information
      * Based on census tract
      * Typical demographic information to include:
         * Age distribution
         * Race distribution
         * Education levels
         * Disability levels
         * SNAP recipients
         * Occupations
         * Children
         * Home type and size
         * Vehicle access
         * Marriage status
         * etc[c]


* Interface
   * The interface to data will primarily be a map data visualization
   * The map will support filtering by grocery and income level characteristics
   * The interface will support a persistent user experience (cookies, sharing of URL, etc).
   * The interface will support the entry of an address to determine census tract
Minimal Viable Product Requirements
1. Interface General Requirements as defined above
2. Food Source and Grocery Store Information
3. Income Level Information
Constraints
* The definitions for grocery and income level are based primarily, but not immodifiably, on the USDA definitions at https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/documentation/#definitions
* The years in question include 2010-today
   * Data from before 2010 will be considered a single archive and not able to be filtered individually by year
* The data will only focus on Davidson County, TN.


This is version one of this project, future versions may have relaxed constraints and/or additional data requirements.
Planning and Engineering
Communication and Work Tracking
* Slack for communication, please join the #food-desert channel in the Code for Nashville slack instance at https://nashville-brigade-slackin.herokuapp.com/ or nashvillebrigade.slack.com
* The Trello will be used for work generation and tracking: https://trello.com/b/Q5Zx2bqh/food-desert-code-for-nashville
* Code will be stored in the (code-for-nashville?) github organization, repository TBD. Currently in https://github.com/wduffee/food-desert-data-project.
Trello Board Organization
* What is a Card?
   * Cards are used to represent tasks and ideas. A card can be something that needs to get done. (from https://trello.com/en-US/guide/trello-101)


* Columns (aka Lists): Used to classify Cards by status
   * Backlog: Cards that have been postponed 
   * New: All cards start in New
   * Accepted: Cards that are ready to be worked, that is each card has a well understood purpose and outcome
   * In Progress: Cards that are being worked
   * Ready for Review: Cards that are ready for review by the team
   * Done: Cards that are completed based on their original purpose/outcome.


* Labels: Used to classify Cards by purpose
   * Data Gathering: Card for producing data that can be used for the implementation of user stories.
   * Definition: Card to define a data object, part of a data set, function, etc.
   * Discovery: Card to research necessary information, such as which tool to use for a mapping engine.
   * Documentation: Card to document information needed for the project’s success.
   * User Story: Card to help define the outcomes of the project’s goals and make sure they are met.

[a]I'm interested in breaking out these into separate projects. I feel like adding all of this to this one starting project is going to try and boil the ocean.
[b]To be read listening to the Miles Davis composition of the same name: So What? https://goo.gl/TYLV2m
[c]The Income Level and Population Information - how can we simplify these to be part of the same schema?


Is the Income Level information one subset of demographic information from the Population Information schema?
